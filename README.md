# Traffic Counting Software Using Python

Transportation surveys are very important at this time, especially in the development of infrastructure in Indonesia. In addition to infrastructure development, traffic impact analysis, transportation management, and traffic engineering also require information related to traffic data from a place. A traffic counting system is needed to monitor and count the number of vehicles passing through the place.

The traffic counting system in this project was developed using Python programming, openCV, and the Haar cascade classifier algorithm. Haar's cascade classifier is chosen because it is easy to use and does not require a GPU to run the system at sufficient speed.

## Objective of this project
1. Detect and classify the vehicles from the inputted video.
2. Tracking the movement of the vehicles.
3. Count the vehicles that passed through the determined line.
